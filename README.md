## Introduction
This application implements a **taxi pooling system in Java using Spring Boot through a Rest API**.<br>
People organized in groups request taxis in order to travel to wherever they want. Each taxi has a specific cost per km and can accommodate as many people as available seats are available.<br>
Whenever the group gets off, they must pay the total cost of the journey.

## Constraints
- Taxi seats can oscillate from 4 to 7.
- Groups are made up of 1 to 7 people.
- Groups only can request a journey once at a time.
- Each taxi can accommodate different groups if they have enough seats available.
- Groups must be served according to their arrival time. A group with a later arrival time can be served earlier than another group as long as no taxi that can serve the earlier groups.
